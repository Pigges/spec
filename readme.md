# LBRY Protocol Specification

LBRY is a protocol for accessing and publishing digital content in a global, decentralized marketplace.

This repo contains the official protocol specification for LBRY. It is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).


## Usage

The spec is available at https://spec.lbry.io. 

To view the content locally, you must have [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) and [bundler](https://bundler.io#getting-started) installed. Then run `bundle install` and `bundle exec jekyll serve`, and open `localhost:4000` in your browser.


## Contributing

To edit the spec:

- run `bundle exec jekyll serve --watch`
- make changes to the markdown
- refresh `localhost:4000` in your browser to see the effect of your changes.
